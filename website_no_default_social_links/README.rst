Website - Remove Default Social Links
#####################################

Website default social (fake) links are removed. Currently only links from default
footer template are removed.

NOTE. Having such links that do not actually point to real social platforms, can cause
google anti phishing service to think that site has "phishing content". So whenever
such links are to be used, it must have real links.
