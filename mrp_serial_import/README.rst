MRP Serial Numbers Import
#########################

Allows to import serial numbers via file, instead of copy/pasting it in wizard text field.

If serial number uses custom fields which need to be set during import, can specify those in file too.

Configuration
=============

Import file must be of :code:`CSV` type. At minimum column called :code:`name` must be set. This is serial number column. Other defined columns will be treated as :code:`stock.production.lot`  extra fields that need to be set when creating it.
