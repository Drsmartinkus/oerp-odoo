Units of Measure - Code
#######################

Adds ``code`` field on Units of Measure model. Standard has ``name`` that usually
indicates standard name of UOM, but it can be translated so some units can be
inconsistent when it is expected to have it standardized.

Also ensures ``code`` used is unique.
