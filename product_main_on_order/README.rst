Main Product on Order
#####################

Adds a model that allows to create rules to identify which of the multiple
products on related order (can be any type of order) is main one.

Sample use case: you want to promote specific product from order, like
including its description in printed document, but do not want to hard code it.

NOTE. This is technical module meant to be used in tandem with some more
specific modules that can use this functionality.
