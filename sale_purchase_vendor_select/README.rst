Sale Purchase - Select Vendor
#############################

If ``Forced Vendor`` is selected on sale order before confirming it, it will
use it when creating purchase orders. But only if that Vendor is in list of specific
product vendors. If its not in a list, then fallback vendor from a list will be
used.
